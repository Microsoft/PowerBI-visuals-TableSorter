# TableSorter
Table Sorter lets you create stacked table columns to explore how different combinations and weightings of numerical column values result in different rank orderings of table records. Column headings show the distribution of column values and support rapid re-sorting of table rows (which may also be filtered by linked visuals). Table Sorter is built on LineUp (http://caleydo.github.io/tools/lineup/)."

## Usage
* Install [node.js 6+](https://nodejs.org)
* Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)
* Run `yarn` in the project directory, which will install all the dependencies
* Run `yarn test` which will lint, test, and compile the `tablesorter`, `tablesorter-react` and `tablesorter-powerbi` packages.
    * Compiling `tablesorter-powerbi` will also create a `.pbiviz` file in the `packages`tablesorter/powerbi/dist/powerbi` directory, which can be imported directly in [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com/)
* Alternatively run `yarn test:powerbi`, which will do the same as `yarn test` but will exclude `tablesorter-react`.
